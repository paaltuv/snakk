# snakk
Fully featured free (as in a hug) forum software written in C#.NET Core 5

Very early stages, with the current focus on getting the structure down.

Planned features:

- REST API 
- Plugin architecture that allows devs to add features or modify existing features. 
- Views for razor pages in database
- Web editor for views that uses a razor engine to allow for IntelliSense of Model properties, with error detection
- Support for both AJAX and full loading of pages
